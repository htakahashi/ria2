I really liked the content that we learned this semester. I didn't think Laravel was going to be very fun to learn but so far it is one of my favorite things I have learned in school. Maybe go over more Auth stuff the videos didn't really go over it as much as I would have liked and I may have missed the day you went over that, if you did. I thought the course was great the way it is.
